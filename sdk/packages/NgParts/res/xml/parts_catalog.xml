<!--
     The parts catalog is used to locate items (usually a PreferenceScreen) inside
     of NgParts. This can be used by NgPartsPreference to create a simple, two-line
     entry point from Settings or another application. All entries should specify
     a fragment, which is a SettingsPreferenceFragment subclass inside BfParts.

     Metadata for the search index provider should be provided for all parts. This
     can be supplied an XML resource in the "lineage:xmlRes" attribute or by implementing
     the Searchable interface.
